# PhishWeb
This is a Chrome Extension which helps with the detection of phishing emails. The extension works for Gmail. 

It will detect phishing mails and warn users about suspicious links or attachments that the email might contain. The extension will check the sender of the email and analyse if the email contains any links which are different from the senderâ€™s domain and warns about attachments as well.
